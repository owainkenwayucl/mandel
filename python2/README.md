# mandel
## Playing with Mandelbrot sets in Python

This is a repository of scripts for playing about with mandelbrot sets in Python.

You can run the scripts with `python`:

```bash
$ python mandel.py
```

will produce a `mandel.pgm` that looks like this:

Plotting is provided by a modified version of the Python 3 module in `pnmmodules` (https://github.com/owainkenwayucl/pnmmodules)
